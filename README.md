# Comparison of statistical methods to quantify synchrony between subjects

This repository contains the R code for the master thesis project.

For data generation: first run the files for generating the data, and then run the files 'Read and save data' to integrate the data into one dataset. datahenon.RData and bvmd.RData are obtained . 

datahenon.RData is generated from Hénon maps, and it is used to reproduce the results of data generated from Hénon maps. 
bvmddata.RData is generated from the bivariate von Mises distribution, and it is for reproducing the results of data generated from the bivariate von Mises distribution. 
The folder 'data generation from Hénon maps' provides the code for generating the data from Hénon maps. Load the data in folder 'Results for data generated from Hénon maps', 
the results for data generated from Hénon maps can be obtained.  The folder 'data generation from bvmd' contains the code for generating the data from the bivariate von Mises distribution. Load the data in folder 'Results for data generated from bvmd', 
the results for data generated from the bivariate von Mises distribution can be obtained.
